# email-resource
Simple Concourse email sending resource

## Credits
This resource was forked from [pivotal-cf's email-resource](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/email-resource) and strongly modified. The
primary changes I made was support for 'inline' subject and body. I just wanted a simple build success/failure notification. It helped my
understanding Go and Concourse :-)


A [Concourse](http://concourse.ci) resource that sends emails.
